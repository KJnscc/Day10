<p>The SSC Tuatara is a sports car designed, developed and manufactured by American automobile manufacturer SSC North America. The car is the successor to the Ultimate Aero and is the result of a design collaboration between Jason Castriota and SSC.
    Initially powered by a 6.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine, the capacity of the engine was later reduced to 5.9 liters in order to allow the engine to have a higher redline of 8,800 rpm.
    SSC had stated that the power output would be rated at 1,350 hp (1,007 kW; 1,369 PS) or 1,750 hp (1,305 kW; 1,774 PS) on E85 fuel, along with a 300+ mph top speed.</p>
